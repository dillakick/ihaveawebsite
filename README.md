# ihaveawebsite/ihazawebzite
A just-add-water type website generator... I think.

### Requirements/requirementzzzz :D
Python 3.x 
[Dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate)
And *possibly* [ngrok](https://ngrok.io).

### How 2 Install???

1. First, get Python at [python.org](https://python.org).
2. Then, get [Dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate).
3. Run dom.py first, since it's the website generator.
4. Profit.

* If you wanna run it on Ngrok or something, you just have to modify d.py and then run it before dom.py. *
